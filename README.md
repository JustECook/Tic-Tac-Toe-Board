# Tic-Tac-Toe-Board
Take a break with a friend and get a few games of tic-tac-toe in. 

Reason for build:

This board has given a good grasp of CSS Grid and Flex properties. A grid was used to make the 3x3 game board. The flex property was used on the body to center the board to the viewport both horizontally and vertically.

Updates:
1. Game is now interactive. User can click a dot and place either an 'X' or 'O'. Once dot is clicked, selection cannot be changed. Selection alternates between
X's and O's using an internal counter. 'O' is even while 'X' is odd. Counter starts at value 0.

Future upgrades:
1. End game when user gets three in a row
2. Draw line through aligned symbols

Feedback is always appreciated :)

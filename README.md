# Tic-Tac-Toe-Board
A snapshot of a game of Tic Tac Toe

Reason for build:

This board has given a good grasp of CSS Grid and Flex properties. A grid was used to make the 3x3 game board. The flex property was used on the body to center the board to the viewport both horizontally and vertically.

Future upgrades:
Make a working game between two users. Game will randomly select who goes first.

Feedback is always appreciated :)
